# BCP-Tools
Brandon's Cisco Python Tools...

I thought I'd keep a more central location for this little fun project. While using netmiko, I've tried to create a few 'functions' that perform specific tasks to make my job a bit less 'manual', not needing to telnet/ssh onto a new deployed switch for example, to get some inventory details.

To do list:

-<b>PHPIPAM examples

-<b>Get better at Python

-<b>Config revision with the basic IOS backup script

-<b>More dynamic scripting, not depending on text files (eg. multipleCommands function)</b>


This project matches my current uses, and I'm looking to develop it more just for the purposes of learning Python. I'm mainly testing these scripts on Cisco switches running IOS 15 but looking to expand it into ASAs (have a few personal functions for shared infrastructure purposes, VPN configs etc...)

TO do list completed:
-<b>Make basic switch inventory function able to create a spreadsheet for inventory purposes [DONE]
